All the work done in this folder is taken from the wonderful book called Data Investigation, EDA the right way.
The book is written by following authors
Vivek Chaudhary
Anirudh Dayma
John Gabriel
Manvendra Singh

All credit goes to them for such a wonderful piece. 
In this folder, I'll be practicing (my own codes) on the datasets provided by the book.

Thanks
